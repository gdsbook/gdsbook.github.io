On May 5th, Dani and friend of the book [Pedro Amaral](https://sites.google.com/site/pedroamaralen/about) will run a session on embedding space in (regression) models.

The session will be based on the "Geographic Data Science with Python" book
and will discuss mainly two of its chapters: [Chapter 11, Spatial
Regression](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/11_regression.html), and [Chapter 12, Spatial Feature Engineering](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/12_feature_engineering.html). You can tag along just to listen or, if you want, you can also follow along running the code on your own machine. Thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), this is a click away on your browser!

**BONUS** -- The session will be *hybrid*, so you can join remotely. 

Here're the coordinates of the event:
