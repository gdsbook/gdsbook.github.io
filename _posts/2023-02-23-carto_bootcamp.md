On February 23rd'23, Levi and Dani participated at CARTO's first [Spatial Data Science bootcamp](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/spatial-data-science-bootcamp-london-2023-tickets-464290293767) in London. This was a one-day training event with many sessions on everything from CARTO's latest offerings to sessions on more foundational topics. Levi and Dani delivered a session that remixed Chapters 6 and 7 into one session on spatial autocorrelation. For his part, Dani used an annotated version of the book that you can find at:

Levi instead took a live approach and freestyled an amazing explanation of
local indicators of spatial autocorrelation on his iPad.

It was a blast to participate and we look forward to future editions!
