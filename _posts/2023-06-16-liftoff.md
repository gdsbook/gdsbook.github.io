Today is the big day. In 2018 (!), we started conversations to turn learning resources we had been developing for a while
into a paper copy book you could buy if you wanted, and always use for free on
the web. CRC agreed and, in 2019, our contract was signed. Initially planned
to be finnished much earlier, the world had different plans for us all...
As we say in Spain, late is better than never. As our CRC agent let us know
this morning, the book is officially published worldwide:

Last week, we also received our own copies:

In preparation for this day, earlier in the spring, we [tagged](https://github.com/gdsbook/book/releases/tag/v1.0) the repository
with the version that is closest to what you can buy in print:

So, it's out there. In the wild. If you want to know a bit more about the
ideas behind writing the book, you can check out our [earlier
post](2019-08-29-project-launch). And remember, today is the day where you can
start *buying* the book if you want to show support for the project, but the
content is (and always will be) openly available and updated, to the best of
our abilities, at:

Happy hacking!

Serge, Levi and Dani.
